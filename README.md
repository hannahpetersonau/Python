# Basic Data Structures Benchmark

An exerpt of a project I worked on in my most recent data structures class, performed in python. The largest portion of structure design was done through the "tests" file, with the "results.md" file going over my findings with each test done on the efficiency of the stacks and queues.

Objectives:
- Demonstrate the current efficiency of stack and queue by running benchmarks to collect data.
- Create two new classes that use a different backing implementation
- Compare the efficiency of the new classes to stack and queue by running benchmark tests to collect data.
- Analyze the results of experiment.
- Summarize findings.
